# assembly-line-simple-game-
This was a game I created a few years back while I was still learning the 'ggez' game engine for rust.

# How to Play
press space to start, move with W (up) and S (down) keys. The goal is to capture the fruits and avoid the poison

# Important Note
the code seems to have broken somehow (I haven't touched in a while so I don't really know what happened). But if you go into the target\debug\gpr_rpc.exe you play the last compiled version before the program broke.
